    "\n",
    "- An API (application programming interface) is a very generic concept. It is the set of rules that define how to communicate with a software application. For example:\n",
    "  - The public elements of a software library are \"the API\" of the library.\n",
    "    - e.g. Pandas `DataFrame`, the methods the class implements, etc. conform the \"Pandas API\".\n",
    "  - Visiting any website is essentially querying a webserver's API that returns HTML.\n",
    "  - An application can expose an API online that you can use to interact programmatically with it.\n",
    "    - e.g. `https://www.google.com/search?q={{QUERY}}` is Google's search engine API."

    "\n",
    "[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is a set of **standards** that specify how an API should behave. \n",
    "- Uniformity across APIs.\n",
    "- Aiming for reliable and performance communication.\n",
    "- Designed originally to specify how  different applications shoul communicate over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most basic level an API is a program in a server that processes **requests** from clients, does some work, and returns **responses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of methods that you can pass to a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GET` Retrieve the resource from the server, **should not mutate** the state of the server (except logs, etc.)\n",
    "- `POST` Create a resource on the server.\n",
    "- `PUT` Update the resource on the server.\n",
    "- `DELETE` Delete the resource from the server.\n",
    "- ... Some more exotic ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [many different response types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) and they're typically clustered together in a number. The most common responde codes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2xx` response sent.\n",
    "- `4xx` the server thinks the client made an error.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Django and Flask are older, bigger, more complex projects. They focus on building webapps with APIs, not just on creating APIs.\n",
    "- FastAPI is exclusively focussed on creating APIS.\n",
    "- FastAPI is extremelly fast and supports concurrent operations (more on that later) by default. It is built on top of [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/).\n",
    "- Follows OpenAPI standards (e.g. standard JSON schemas that communicate how the API behaves, rules for code-generation).\n",
    "- Automatic data-model validation (built on top of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)) and documentation.\n",
    "- Type-safe (at least relatively safe for python standards).\n",
    "- Built-in Swagger UI (most popular API tooling framework, original creators of OpenAPI)."
