    "If you use Pydantic types to model the output of you APIs:\n",
    "  - You can validate the output of your endpoints. If the data is invalid you'd want your code to fail, not to return invalid data.\n",
    "  - It allows you to declare what data your API returns (and filter what it shouldn't return) in an ergonomic way.\n",
    "  - There is a single *source of truth* about what data is returned: the Pydantic models.\n",
    "  - You get documentation *for free* and an automatic JSON schema (at `entrypoint/openapi.json`, also accesible from the `/docs` endpoint).\n",

    "### Miscellaneous tips\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you need to return an object that can't be a Pydantic model for some reason (e.g. database object, raw dictionary), you can still do data validation and filtering by specifying the output type of your endpoint to be a Pydantic model. However, this will break linting and other IDE niceties. To circumvent this you can set the `response_model=PydanticModel` parameter in the endpoint decorator and specifying the return type of your endpoint function as `Any`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can disable the response validation that FastAPI performs by default by setting the endpoitn argument `response_model=None`, but don't unless you have a good reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can use the `default_response` argument of the `FastAPI` constructor to specify a default response type for all endpoints. Quite common to use with `default_response_class=ORJSONResponse` if you're building a pure JSON API. "
